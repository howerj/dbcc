.SH NAME
dbcc \- Compile DBC files into C code
.SH SYNOPSIS
dbcc [-] [-h] [-v] [-g] [-t] [-x] [-j] [-C] [-D] [-o dir] file*
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a DBC file containing descriptions of CAN messages this program will parse
that file and generate C functions that can serialize and deserialize those
messages. Optionally it can produce XML, JSON, or a CSV file, instead of C.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -
Stop processing command line arguments

.TP
.B -h
Print a help message to stderr(3) and exit the program unsuccessfully.

.TP
.B -v
Increase the verbosity level of the program.

.TP
.B -g
Print out the grammar used to parse the DBC files, the DBC format is whitespace
sensitive so it looks a lot uglier than it should be if the DBC format has been
designed correctly.

.TP
.B -t
Add timestamps to the generated files.

.TP
.B -x
Produce an XML file instead of a C code and header file.

.TP
.B -j
Produce a JSON file instead of a C code and header file.

.TP
.B -C
Produce a CSV file instead of a C code and header file.

.TP
.B -b     
Convert output to BSM (beSTORM) instead of C and header file

.TP
.B -o dir
Set the output directory

.TP
.B -p
Generate only code to print out CAN messages. Only effect C code generation, if
neither '-p', '-k' or '-u' are specified all code is generated. This option can
be specified along with any of the other code limiting options.

.TP
.B -k
Generate only code to pack CAN messages. Only effect C code generation, if
neither '-p', '-k' or '-u' are specified all code is generated. This option can
be specified along with any of the other code limiting options.

.TP
.B -u
Generate only code to unpack CAN messages. Only effect C code generation, if
neither '-p', '-k' or '-u' are specified all code is generated. This option can
be specified along with any of the other code limiting options.

.TP
.B -s
Disable asserts in generated code. Bad on you for doing this.

.TP
.B -D
This option only affects C code generation.

In lieu of generics, you can make all of the encode/decode functions use double
width floating point types instead of the smallest typed needed for that
signal. 

.TP
.B file
A DBC file to process

.SH EXAMPLES

.B
	./dbcc file.dbc

This will run the program on a DBC file called
.I file.dbc 
and make two files, one called
.I file.c
and another called
.I file.h

.SH EXIT STATUS

This command returns zero on success and non zero on failure.

.SH BUGS
The program is in alpha status and thus is unlikely to work or be complete.

This program may produce invalid C, which may be accepted by your compiler
depending on how liberal it is with characters outside of the
range allowed by C in comments. The units string of a CAN DBC file can contain 
Unicode characters, which will be put into a comment in the generated C code.

As a work around, use iconv(1) on any input DBC that has non-ASCII 
characters in it, or is not in ASCII encoded, like so:

.B iconv -t -c utf8.dbc > ascii.dbc
